## The 7 characteristics

I use the 7 characteristics for guidance when I am coaching organizations or building teams. These 7 characteristics don't comprehensively cover all situations. They are not a playbook or a magic formula. They are characteristics that guide my thinking and help me to make decisions about the coaching I need to provide. They are distillations of years of reading, experiencing, failing, succeeding, and learning.

Each section of this book explores one characteristic in detail.
