# Introduction

In some ways, I've been writing this book since 1989. But, if pressed, I'd say this book began in 2019.

In March of 2019, I was consulting at a large automotive company and had been assigned to help out a new initiative. We had the audacious goal of reducing the cycle time for a car from order to delivery by 65%. We began by pulling together people from all over the company; sales, order entry, supplier management, scheduling, sequencing, manufacturing, distribution, and IT were all represented.

We ran workshops for several days where we looked at every step of the flow from the moment a dealer places a wholesale order to the moment the vehicle arrives on the lot. There were a lot of ah-hah moments where one department explained how difficult their process was because of some missing or wrong data or because of some extended delay outside of their scope. In many cases, other departments were able to alleviate the pain by providing better data or by adjusting their own process in order to remove a bottleneck. Through all of it, we saw improvements in cycle time - some of them fairly significant, but we were far from our goal.

Then a woman named Angie spoke up. She was standing in front of a massive whiteboard upon which we'd drawn a model of the flow. She pointed at a rather complicated piece of the flow and asked, "Can anyone tell me why we do it this way?" There was a long pause and and a lot of blank stares, so she continued, "This has never made sense to me. We get high-level numbers from the dealers, telling us how many of each model they want. We then go through this whole mess of calculations to tell them what packages and features they are each going to get. We don't really give them much choice. Then the games begin. We get all prepared to make all these cars, figuring out exactly what's going to happen in the supply chains, what car will be built when and on what line and all the other work that needs to happen.", she gestures to a large area of the board.

Tom, a seasoned veteran of the automotive industry and the most tenured member of the department, interrupted her. "We've been over this before, Angie. We need the dealer forecast to get a sense of what they intend. That is necessary for us to generate recommendations and try to balance dealer needs against our own needs and our market projections. This is the way it is, Angie. We need to focus on areas where we can drive efficiencies. Where can we speed up a step?"

Angie raises a finger, "Hear me out, Tom. I didn't get to the games. Now that we've made our 90-day plan, dealers start modifying the orders. Denver wants more all wheel drives. Florida wants fewer. Customer orders, which take priority, start coming in and wholesale orders start getting canceled. We can see them gaming the system; writing up customer orders that then go on the lot because they 'lost the sale due to manufacturing delays'. There is a ton of re-work that has to happen. We're adjusting on the fly, expediting materials, sometimes taking down production lines for a change-over. Cycle times go up and so do costs. We need wholesale orders 90 days in advance because all of this churn causes delays. Because of the delays, we get more churn. It's a vicious cycle."

Drew, Tom's right-hand man, and probably the most informed on how both the business process and IT processes work, has been walking over to where Angie is standing, his hand on his chin as he stares at the board. "What are you suggesting, Angie?", he asks, "What do you think needs to happen?" Drew is visibly excited. He's pretty sure he knows where Angie is going and he knows it is currently not possible, but maybe, just maybe, it could be made possible. This new agile approach he's seen on some teams has given Drew some renewed hope.

Angie pointed to the beginning of the flow. "We need to get a real commitment from the dealers. We need to let them choose the cars they want. Not just the models, but the packages and features. We need to work with them to create the schedule. We expect them to just accept the cars we allocate to them. We keep trying to get better at guessing over longer and longer periods of time. Let's guess less and shorten the timeline. Seriously, it could make a huge difference."

Tom furrowed his brow. He'd been down this road before. "Look, Dealers are always going to game the system. It's just what they do. We do our best to work with them, but they don't care about supply chains and delays. They don't want to hear about constraints or even what we think the market is going to do."

"Hah.", interjected Angie, "Maybe if we weren't shoving cars they can't sell down their throats, they'd care more about our constraints."

"Okay, okay.", said Drew, "Step back folks. Angie is on to something here. If we can get a real commitment, we can reduce the re-work. Not only that, but I think we can actually cut entire steps out of the flow and move some other things to later in the flow where re-work won't impact them any more. We just might be able to get this down to under our target."

Tom, red-faced and fists clenched, left the session. The rest of the crew stayed to talk through what exactly would need to happen in order to make this work.

A few days later, the crew had come up with a plan and, to Tom's chagrin, senior management had approved it. Under this new plan, Dealers would first make a high-level forecast as they'd always done, but we'd ask them for only the next 30 days worth of vehicles, not the next 90 days. We'd then run a round of recommendations on the 30 day data. This was again like it had always been done, except for 30 days instead of 90. Then, the new process would kick in - dealers would have a few days to make adjustments to the plan. They could make just about any change they wanted, so long as their combination of orders stayed within certain constraints. We'd openly share with them the key constraints we were facing, such as a limited number of sunroofs or drive trains. We'd enforce the constraints in the wholesale software and give them clear feedback and guidance.

There were only a couple of minor things to take care of. The wholesale order entry software we needed didn't exist and there was no team to build it.
