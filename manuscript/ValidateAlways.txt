#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-driven development is a style of programming that involves a cycle of three activities executed in short cycles: Test, Code, Refactor. The steps can be described as follows:

- Test
  - write a unit test specifying a specific behavior
  - run the test
    - confirm it fails because the program lacks that behavior
- Code
  - write rudimentary code in order to make the test pass
    - might involve duplication, non-expressive names, etc.
  - confirm the new test passes
  - confirm all tests pass
- Refactor
  - eliminate duplication
  - clearly express intent
  - remove superfluous parts
  - confirm all tests pass
