## Create Simple Things

What is a simple thing?

For our purposes, simple indicates something that has few components and is easy to understand. This is the essence of well composed solutions - they are comprised of small simple components.

Kent Beck describes Simple Design using 4 rules[^^SimplicityRules]:
1. Passes all the tests.
1. Express every idea we need to express.
1. Duplicates no behavior or configuration.
1. Has no superfluous parts.
