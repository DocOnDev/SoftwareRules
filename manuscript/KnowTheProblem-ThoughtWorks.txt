Around 2009, I was working for ThoughtWorks and helping to lead a large re-write for a leader in the airline industry. The airline had their own in-house development staff complete with architects, designers, project managers, and software developers. While they'd contracted to us for this significant effort, they kept their teams very active in the process - something we welcomed from our clients.

Their commerce website was key to their business strategy. They weren't going to let this project fail. Prior to engaging us, their team had done a great deal of discovery and design. They had a comprehensive architecture design and a backlog of prioritized stories detailed with functional specifications and high-fidelity screen prototypes. The re-write was to take two years to complete and would then replace the old system all at once.

As you might imagine, this wasn't the way ThoughtWorks operated. We convinced them to do the job iteratively and incrementally. We'd tease out and replace aspects of the software while leaving the rest of it in place. No grand ta-da after a multi-year effort. We'd start delivering working software and real value in the first couple of months and every week, if not multiple times per week, thereafter.

We decided to start with the booking flow as this was not only where the majority of customer complaints came from, but it had a direct impact on revenue. Over the past year, abandonment rates were increasing on the site and calls to central booking were increasing. Quite simply - customers booking flights through a central booking agent was more expensive to the company than customers booking flights online.

The primary issue with the booking flow was response times. The site often took over a minute to display a listing of flight options. The listing showed departure and arrival times, flight duration, and tickets available. If you wanted to see details such as the location and length of a layover, you had to click on the flight and wait for another screen to load. If you didn't like the layover, you had to return to the search, which would take another minute or more to display. Booking flights often took thirty minutes or more for a basic round-trip fare. It took less than 10 minutes to book the same flight through an agent. Quite simply - booking flights through a central booking agent was faster and easier than booking flights online.

* Customer provided detailed designs of screens, architecture, database schemas, and the object model.
* Design accounted for one way, round trip, multi-stop, open-ended, children, pets, and other special circumstances
* Decided to start simple and build as we needed with the detailed design as a guide, but not a requirement
* In September 2009 - learned new security measures were being put into place by the TSA, effective January 2010.
* Were able to get new passenger identification requirements in place
